* [csf.tgz](csf.tgz) - this is CSF Firewall GPLv3 open source release version v15.00 and details, changes and migration/download guide are outlined in [README-gpl-csf.md](README-gpl-csf.md). Jump to migration guide [here](README-gpl-csf.md#-migration-guide). See commit history for the file at <https://github.com/centminmod/configserver-scripts/commits/main/csf.tgz>.

Update: December 19, 2025

- The official repo at <https://github.com/waytotheweb/scripts> no longer exists. You can use this forked repo instead  <https://github.com/centminmod/configserver-scripts> which is forked from <https://github.com/waytotheweb/scripts>. GitHub incorrectly says this repo is forked from `mappy9211` repo version - it is **NOT** forked from `mappy9211` repo version. You can inspect this forked repo's commit history at <https://github.com/centminmod/configserver-scripts/commits/main/>.
- The official CSF Firewall GPLv3 open source release version is v15.00 and details, changes and migration/download guide are outlined in [README-gpl-csf.md](README-gpl-csf.md). Jump to migration guide [here](README-gpl-csf.md#-migration-guide).
- The official CSF Firewall v15.00 GPLv3 open source release disables the download and version check routines in code, so there is no more auto-updating functionality. You will be stuck on v15.00 until you manually update to newer versions or forks in the future. Some control panels and providers are self-hosting their own CSF Firewall forks which have restored download and version check routines in code. Control panels such as [DirectAdmin](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/) and [Centmin Mod](https://blog.centminmod.com/2025/09/04/2921/configserver-csf-firewall-shutdown-on-august-31-2025/) have their own forks of CSF Firewall with their own download and version check routines restored in code. cPanel has [announced](https://features.cpanel.net/c/202-firewall-configuration-tool) they will have their own fork of CSF Firewall sometime in early 2026.
- One leading CSF Firewall fork is contender is Aetherinox CSF Firewall Fork <https://github.com/Aetherinox/csf-firewall> with many changes beyond CSF Firewall v15.00 GPLv3 open source release. I am not using this fork but my own Centmin Mod CSF Firewall mirror fork for now. But I am personally tracking Aetherinox CSF Firewall fork's changes in dedicated GitHub repo at <https://github.com/centminmod/csf-firewall-aetherinox-tracking> to fully understand the changes. Direct link to fork's changes file at <https://github.com/centminmod/csf-firewall-aetherinox-tracking/blob/master/aetherinox-fork-changes.md>.

### Important Notice

Way to the Web Ltd and [Configserver.com](http://configserver.com) will be closing down permanently on **31 August 2025**. The server software market has changed drastically in the more than 25 years since our company began, and we now find the business is no longer profitable so must come to an end.

This closure affects all of our commercial software including:

- ConfigServer Exploit Scanner (cxs)
- MailScanner Front-End (MSFE)
- Outgoing Spam Monitor (osm)

It also affects our free software including:

- ConfigServer Security and Firewall (csf)
- ConfigServer Mail Queues (cmq)
- ConfigServer Mail Manage (cmm)
- ConfigServer Modsecurity Control (cmc)
- ConfigServer Explorer (cse)

After 31st August, there will be no further support, downloads, or license IP changes available.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: In order to continue using any of our commercial software after the 31st of August, you must update the software to the latest version. If not updated, any of our commercial software products will cease to function and cannot be reactivated once the download and license servers are shut down.**
